## Description
This is multiple page e-commerce project, which sells different pottery products. The project was fully written on React.

## Structure of project
Generally, project consists of 8 pages which are:
* Home
* About
* Shop
* Delivery
* Blog 
* Contact
* Bag
* Cards' additional information <br/>

All pages has their own features, that will be mentioned below.

## Technologies 
What I used in project:
* React. For react there were used libraries and packages such as:
  - React router - for switching the pages without loading.
  - React-cards - for ready structure of cards.
  - React-google-maps - for showing the location of shop on the page Contact (which could not work right now because of expiration date)
* SCSS. Some libraries related to styles are:
  - Animate css - for animation of texts on pages 
   - Framer motion - for some effects on website, precisely: 
     - Product image 3D effect, that you can see by clicking to any product and moving to product additional information page
     - Dragging effect on "Send" icon which is on Contact page. You can drag the icon and move inside the box.
   - Reveal animation - which is for animation of elements on scroll. You can see this effect scrolling down and elements will appear smoothly
